- Mod setting for max revives per unit. Avoid infinitely reviving the same biter every tick. Not needed in commands. Does require getting unit_number of each entity scheduled for revival and tracking forwards into new unit_number and checking each dead entity to tidy up the table if it's not chosen for a repeat revival.
- Mod setting for zzz (configurable text) floating text over units delayed for reviving when they are delayed for more than 2 (test this looks right) seconds.
- Track biters marked for reviving corpses so we can remove them when the biter revives. Would need to monitor additional events to populate the corpse list and link the 2 events together.
