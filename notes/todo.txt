Publish a custom event for when a biter isn't revived, so other mods can listen for it and not on_entity died. Only for `{ filter = "type", type = "unit" }` and will need to be done in all non-revived cases for units.
Add mod setting to revive worms (biological turrets) equally to biters. Will not include extra options to treat them differently.
Check if there's any UPS savings from caching to be made.
