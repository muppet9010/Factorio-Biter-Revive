- Reshuffle functions to make them easier to find.
- Reduce force cache from 1 minute down to 10 seconds so that modded/script evolution changes will appear quickly.


- Mod setting for zzz (configurable text) floating text over units delayed for reviving when they are delayed for more than 2 (test this looks right) seconds. Have extra option to include a countdown against it with a warning it will impact UPS.


- Add a gif to the mod portal page at the top
- Spell check readme and locale.
